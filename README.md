And type your settings as below:

```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI:
    "mongodb+srv://----YOUR-MONGODB-ATLAS-KEY----",
  emailAddress: "----YOUR-GMAIL-ADDRESS----",
  emailPassword: "----YOUR-MAIL-PASSWORD----",
};
```

email address will be used as a mail which sends password reset messages.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
